# About

## Hello! I'm TheCodeCat

I'm a quirky nerd developer from Italy who's been coding for 15 years now. I've been through the ups and downs of programming, from the early days of VB6 to the latest .NET framework. I've worked on all sorts of projects, from desktop applications to libraries, web applications, and more.

I'm 36 years old, married, and thinking about starting a family soon. When I'm not coding, I love exploring the wonders of philosophy, psychology, and artificial intelligence. I find myself particularly drawn to the creation of AI art and generative art.

I'm a Cancer, and like all Cancerians, I have a warm and nurturing personality. I work and study from the comfort of my home studio, surrounded by all my favorite things. I'm always eager to share my thoughts and experiences, and that's why I started this blog.

## Why TheCodeCat blog?

I was inspired to start this blog by other tech writers on Twitter, my need to express myself, and my desire to grow my business. I wanted to create a platform where I can share my passion for programming, C#, Azure, Docker, Kubernetes, cloud computing, AI, AI art, generative art, and tech news.

My goal is to reach out to as many people as possible, especially those who are just starting out on their programming journey. I want to share my knowledge and experiences, and hopefully inspire others to pursue their passions as well.

So, if you're looking for engaging and informative articles about tech and programming, you've come to the right place! I hope you enjoy reading my blog as much as I enjoy writing it.
